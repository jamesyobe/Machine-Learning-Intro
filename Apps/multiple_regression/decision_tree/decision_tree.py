In this chapter we will show you how to make a "Decision Tree". A Decision Tree is a Flow Chart, and can help you make decisions based on previous experience.

In the example, a person will try to decide if he/she should go to a comedy show or not.

Luckily our example person has registered every time there was a comedy show in town, and registered some information about the comedian, and also registered if he/she went or not.
