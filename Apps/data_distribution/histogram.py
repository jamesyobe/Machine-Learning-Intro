Data Distribution
Earlier in this tutorial we have worked with very small amounts of data in our examples, just to understand the different concepts.

In the real world, the data sets are much bigger, but it can be difficult to gather real world data, at least at an early stage of a project.

How Can we Get Big Data Sets?
To create big data sets for testing, we use the Python module NumPy, which comes with a number of methods to create random data sets, of any size

Create an array containing 250 random floats between 0 and 5:

To visualize the data set we can draw a histogram with the data we collected.

We will use the Python module Matplotlib to draw a histogram.

Learn about the Matplotlib module in our Matplotlib Tutorial.
"""
import numpy

import os
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
os.system('cls')
data = numpy.random.uniform(0.0, 5.0, 250)

plt.hist(data, 5)
plt.show()

"""
Histogram Explained
We use the array from the example above to draw a histogram with 5 bars.

The first bar represents how many values in the array are between 0 and 1.

The second bar represents how many values are between 1 and 2.

Etc.

Which gives us this result:

52 values are between 0 and 1
48 values are between 1 and 2
49 values are between 2 and 3
51 values are between 3 and 4
50 values are between 4 and 5
